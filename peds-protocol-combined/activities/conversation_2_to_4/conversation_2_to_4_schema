  "description": "As you look at the book together, encourage the child to comment on what they see, etc. by using gestures and facial expressions to keep them engaged. Point to pictures and use simple comments like “wow”, “oh no”“look!” “uh oh”, “awww” – this can encourage the child to comment ina more spontaneous, elaborative way. Pretend to knock on the flaps (like a door) and “investigate” who or what is hiding underneath",
